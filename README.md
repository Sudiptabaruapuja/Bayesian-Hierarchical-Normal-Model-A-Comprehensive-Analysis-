The hierarchical normal model is a powerful tool in Bayesian statistics, used to model data with natural groupings, where observations within each group are assumed to be normally distributed with their own 
means. This model is beneficial for understanding variability both within and between groups. In this report, we explore the hierarchical normal model through a Bayesian lens, employing Gibbs sampling for posterior 
inference. We provide detailed mathematical formulations, simulated data analysis, and a thorough discussion of the results. That raises the question of our reseach interest.
